<strong>Version {{$appVersion}} change notes:</strong>
<br />
The notification monitor was overhauled internally, a long overdue task required from the growing set of features
complicating the code. VH now tries to tracks the vine tier availability of items and implemented a concept of devices
to complement the UUID system.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Change log:
<ul>
	<li>NEW: Added link next to the ASIN in the saved reviews list.</li>
	<li>
		NEW: <strong>Device name and id</strong> VH now allow you to set a custom device name, so you can identify which
		device are linked to a specific UUID. Additionally, each device now gets a unique(-ish) id (an anonymous
		fingerprint containing no data) that is used to identify the device alongside the UUID.
	</li>
	<li>
		NEW: <strong>Details icon</strong> in the toolbar. Clicking on it will open a popup with the item's details.
	</li>
	<li>
		CHANGE: <strong>Unavailable tab</strong> now regroup the items which have received an ITEM_NOT_IN_ENROLLMENT
		error, and no longer rely on the successful/unsuccessful order counts. This behavior is now in line with the
		notifications monitor.
