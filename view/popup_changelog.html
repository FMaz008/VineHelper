<strong>Version {{$appVersion}} change notes:</strong>
<br />
<ul>
	<li>
		NEW: <strong>Notification Monitor v2</strong>. Now accessible from the top right of Vine Pages, the new NM is
		fully integrated with Vine, making it possible to:
		<ul>
			<li>open the See Details page directly</li>
			<li>have its design be that of a regular listing and conform to your preferences</li>
			<li>
				better follow VH's core principle of improving Vine experience instead of creating a parallel interface
			</li>
			<li>When pausing the feed, a count of how many items are in the buffer is displayed.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		CHANGE: <strong>Patreon (Beta)</strong>. Due to the increasing amount of users, a patreon system was put in
		place to support the project. Paywalled options were selected for <strong>not</strong> being paid to win, or
		core features. Premium settings are designated with a diamond (
		<div class="vh-toolbar-icon vh-icon-premium"></div>
		) next to them. <br />I realize the subscription model is not convenient for everyone, as such, previous forms
		of donations are still very welcome and available but will not unlock premium features. You can access the
		Patreon from the "?" tab in the settings.
