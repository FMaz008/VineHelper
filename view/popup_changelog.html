<strong>Version {{$appVersion}} change notes:</strong>
<br />
<ul>
	<li>
		NEW: <strong>Notification Monitor v2</strong>. Now accessible from the top right of Vine Pages, the new NM is
		fully integrated with Vine, making it possible to:
		<ul>
			<li>open the See Details page directly</li>
			<li>have its design be that of a regular listing and conform to your preferences</li>
			<li>
				better follow VH's core principle of improving Vine experience instead of creating a parallel interface
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		CHANGE: <strong>Patreon</strong>. Due to the increasing amount of users, a patreon system was put in place to
		support the project. Paywalled options were selected for <strong>not</strong> being paid to win, or core
		features. Premium settings are designated with a diamond (
		<div class="vh-toolbar-icon vh-icon-premium"></div>
		) next to them. <br />I realize the subscription model is not convenient for everyone, as such previous forms of
		donations are still very welcome and available but will not unlock features. You can access the Patreon from the
		"?" tab in the settings.
	</li>
	<li>NEW: Color picker tool to select your colors in the settings</li>
	<li>NEW: Edit saved reviews.</li>
	<li>NEW: Review toolbar is now optional</li>
	<li>NEW: Account statistics projection now optional</li>
	<li>
		NEW: Blur keywords
		<div class="vh-toolbar-icon vh-icon-premium"></div>
		: Will blur thumbnail and title of items matching those keywords.
	</li>
	<li>NEW: Support for Australia, Brazil, Mexico and Singapor.</li>
	<li>REMOVAL: Removal of the "Recommendations" link as it was shown to have no effect on RFY.</li>
