# Dependency Injection Implementation History

## Overview
This document consolidates the history of the Dependency Injection (DI) system implementation in VineHelper.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Initial DI Framework
- Created basic DI container for service registration
- Implemented service worker initialization
- Added backward compatibility layers

### Phase 2: Keyword Compilation Service
- Attempted to share compiled keywords across contexts
- Discovered limitations with content script isolation
- Service worker-only compilation service

### Phase 3: Settings Manager Migration
- Migrated from SettingsMgr to SettingsMgrDI
- Added compatibility layer (SettingsMgrCompat)
- Maintained backward compatibility for gradual migration

## Key Challenges

### Cross-Context Communication
- Content scripts cannot directly access service worker services
- Chrome runtime messaging required for cross-context sharing
- Compilation service remains isolated to service worker

### Backward Compatibility
- Legacy code expects global objects
- Gradual migration strategy implemented
- Compatibility layers maintain functionality

## Current State
- DI system functional in service worker
- Content scripts use local compilation
- Settings successfully migrated to DI
- Further architectural changes needed for full DI adoption
