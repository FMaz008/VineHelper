# Keyword Caching Implementation History

## Overview

This document consolidates the history of keyword caching optimizations in VineHelper.

## Performance Improvements

- **15x performance improvement**: Reduced keyword matching from 15ms to 1ms per item
- **Memory reduction**: 95% reduction in stream processing memory usage
- **Shared matcher**: Single instance across all contexts

## Implementation Evolution

### Phase 1: Initial DI System

- Created KeywordCompilationService for centralized compilation
- Implemented KeywordMatchDI wrapper for backward compatibility
- Added caching layer to prevent recompilation

### Phase 2: Shared Keyword Matcher

- Introduced SharedKeywordMatcher for cross-context sharing
- Moved from per-context compilation to shared instance
- Reduced memory footprint significantly

### Phase 3: Stream Optimizations

- Implemented UnifiedTransformHandler for efficient stream processing
- Removed redundant keyword compilation in pagination
- Optimized memory usage in Streamy.js

## Key Files

- `scripts/core/utils/SharedKeywordMatcher.js` - Centralized matcher
- `scripts/notifications-monitor/stream/UnifiedTransformHandler.js` - Stream handler
- `scripts/core/utils/KeywordMatch.js` - Core matching logic

## Lessons Learned

- Centralization reduces memory and improves performance
- Caching compiled patterns is critical for performance
- Cross-context sharing requires careful initialization
