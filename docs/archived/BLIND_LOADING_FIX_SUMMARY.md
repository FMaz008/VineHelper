# BlindLoading Flicker Fix Summary

## Problem

Even with the BlindLoading option enabled, users were still seeing the original Amazon items flicker on screen before VineHelper processed and rearranged them. This was particularly noticeable during pagination.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Inline Style Override**: Amazon's JavaScript was setting inline styles directly on the grid container (`style="display: block; visibility: visible;"`), which have higher specificity than CSS rules.
2. **Timing Issue**: The previous CSS-only approach wasn't aggressive enough to prevent Amazon's JS from showing the content.
3. **Multiple Code Paths**: The grid was being shown in multiple places without consistent handling of the BlindLoading setting.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Attribute-based CSS with !important (preboot.js)

- Uses `body:not([data-vh-ready])` selector to conditionally hide containers
- Added `!important` to CSS rules to override inline styles
- Applied hiding to multiple containers for comprehensive coverage:
    - `#vvp-items-grid-container`
    - `#vvp-items-grid`
    - `.vvp-items-container`
- CSS only applies when VineHelper hasn't signaled it's ready

### 2. MutationObserver Protection (bootloader.js)

- Implemented in bootloader.js to avoid Content Security Policy violations
- Creates a MutationObserver after Settings are loaded
- Watches for any attempts to show the grid and forces it to stay hidden
- Only active when BlindLoading is enabled
- Properly cleaned up when processing completes

### 3. Centralized Display Logic (bootloader.js)

- Created `showGridContainer()` helper function
- Adds `data-vh-ready="true"` attribute to body element
- This attribute allows the CSS rules to stop hiding the containers
- Clears any inline styles that might interfere
- Ensures consistent behavior across all code paths:
    - Normal completion after processing
    - Error cases (network timeout, invalid UUID)
    - Empty product lists
- Sets `window.vhReadyToShow = true` flag
- Disconnects and cleans up the MutationObserver

## Testing Instructions

1. Enable BlindLoading in VineHelper settings
2. Navigate to any Vine page (RFY, AFA, or AI)
3. Click through pagination links
4. Verify that items don't flicker - they should appear all at once after processing

## Technical Details

The fix uses a multi-layered approach:

- **Layer 1**: CSS with !important (catches most cases)
- **Layer 2**: MutationObserver (catches dynamic changes)
- **Layer 3**: Consistent show logic (ensures proper cleanup)

This ensures that even if Amazon changes their implementation, we have multiple safeguards in place to prevent the flicker.
