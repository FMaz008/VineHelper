# VineHelper Notification System - Current State

## System Overview

The VineHelper notification system is a real-time monitoring system that tracks and notifies users about new Amazon Vine items as they become available. It provides visual and audio notifications, manages item visibility and counts, and coordinates across multiple browser tabs/windows.

### Core Functionality
- Real-time item detection and notification
- Visual highlighting and filtering of items based on keywords
- Accurate count tracking of visible items
- Audio and OS notifications for new items
- Multi-monitor/tab coordination to prevent duplicate notifications
- Performance-optimized stream processing

### Key Performance Metrics
- **Processing Speed**: 1ms per item (previously 15ms)
- **Memory Usage**: ~300KB for stream processing (previously 9.4MB)
- **Redundant Processing**: Eliminated (was 8-11x per item, now 1x)
- **Regex Compilations**: ~100 total (previously 353,000)
- **Test Coverage**: 296 tests passing, 6 skipped

## Architecture

### High-Level Component Overview

The notification system consists of several interconnected components:

1. **NotificationMonitor** - Core monitoring logic that processes items and manages visibility
2. **VisibilityStateManager** - Centralized service for visibility state and count management
3. **MasterSlave** - Coordinates notifications across multiple browser tabs/windows
4. **Stream Processing** - Efficient pipeline for processing incoming items
5. **UI Components** - Sound player, screen notifier, and visual elements

### Data Flow

```
WebSocket Server → Master Monitor → Stream Processing → UI Updates
                                 ↓
                         BroadcastChannel
                                 ↓
                          Slave Monitors
```

### Key Services

**VisibilityStateManager**
- Tracks which items are visible/hidden
- Maintains accurate count of visible items
- Uses WeakMap caching for performance
- Emits visibility change events for UI updates
- Supports batch operations and count suspension

**NotificationMonitor**
- Processes incoming items and applies filters
- Manages item visibility based on user settings
- Handles different item types (Zero ETV, Unknown ETV, etc.)
- Optimized to eliminate redundant processing

**MasterSlave Coordination**
- Uses BroadcastChannel API for inter-tab communication
- Only master tab processes notifications and plays sounds
- Automatic failover when master tab closes
- Prevents duplicate notifications across windows

**Stream Processing**
- Unified transform handler for all operations
- Shared keyword matcher with caching
- Pre-compiled regex patterns for performance
- Single-pass processing for efficiency

## Implementation Status

## Known Issues

1. **OS notifications for keyword matches may not work**
   - Could be related to browser notification permissions or settings configuration
   - Some users report OS notifications not appearing for keyword-matched items
   - Priority: Low (likely user configuration issue)

## Debug and Testing Guide

### Available Debug Flags

The notification system includes comprehensive debug logging that can be enabled via console:

```javascript
// Enable notification-specific debugging
window.DEBUG_NOTIFICATIONS = true

// Enable visibility state debugging
window.DEBUG_VISIBILITY_STATE = true

// Or use localStorage for persistent debugging
localStorage.setItem("vh_debug_notifications", "true")
```

### What Gets Logged

When debug mode is enabled:
- Sound notification attempts and playback status
- OS notification creation and duplicate prevention
- Item detection and processing events
- Visibility state changes and count updates
- Master/slave coordination events
- Stream processing operations

### Key Testing Procedures

1. **Verify Count Accuracy**
   - Switch between filters (All, Zero ETV, etc.)
   - Confirm counts match visible items
   - Check pause button and tab title sync

2. **Test Notification Functions**
   - Enable sound notifications and verify playback
   - Test OS notifications appear only once per item
   - Verify multi-monitor coordination

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Use "Last 100" or "Last 12 hours" fetch
   - Monitor for UI responsiveness
   - Check console for processing metrics

4. **Edge Case Testing**
   - Test with items having Unknown ETV
   - Verify no duplicate items appear
   - Test filter combinations

### Common Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Counts seem incorrect**
   - Enable debug logging to see visibility calculations
   - Check for any console errors
   - Verify filters are applied correctly

2. **Notifications not working**
   - Check browser notification permissions
   - Verify sound files are loading (check Network tab)
   - Ensure master/slave coordination is working

3. **Performance issues**
   - Check if count update suspension is working during fetches
   - Look for redundant processing in debug logs
   - Verify keyword caching is functioning

## Future Improvements

### Simplified Counting Architecture

The current incremental counting approach, while functional, involves complex state tracking. A simpler "recount" approach could:
- Eliminate entire classes of synchronization bugs
- Reduce code complexity by 70%
- Have negligible performance impact (2-10ms for 200 items)
- Provide single source of truth (DOM)

### Resilience to Amazon Code Changes

Current vulnerabilities:
- Relies on specific CSS classes
- Assumes consistent DOM structure
- Complex state tracking increases fragility

Recommended improvements:
- Configurable selectors
- Fallback detection methods
- Reduced dependencies on implementation details

### Performance Optimization Opportunities

1. **Virtual Scrolling**
   - Only render visible items
   - Constant memory usage regardless of item count
   - Better initial load times

2. **Enhanced Caching**
   - Implement LRU eviction for large keyword sets
   - Add cache warming on startup
   - Further optimize regex compilation

3. **Event System Improvements**
   - Implement event batching for performance
   - Create typed event system
   - Add event debugging capabilities

### Long-Term Vision

1. **Architecture Simplification**
   - Single source of truth for counts (DOM-based)
   - Direct count calculation instead of incremental
   - Minimal state management

2. **Enhanced Testing**
   - Integration tests for fetch operations
   - Performance benchmarks for large item counts
   - Automated regression testing

3. **Monitoring and Analytics**
   - Built-in performance metrics
   - User experience tracking
   - Automated performance regression detection
