# VineHelper Project Status and Roadmap

## Overview

This document consolidates the current project status, completed fixes, open issues, and future improvements for the VineHelper browser extension.

## Completed Fixes (as of 7/5/2025)

### Critical Bug Fixes

1. **Filter Not Applied During Bulk Fetch** - Fixed filter state application during bulk operations
2. **Sounds Not Respecting Filter** - Modified sound logic to check filter visibility
3. **Duplicate Items** - Implemented ASIN-based deduplication with mutex locking
4. **Visibility Count Mismatch** - Enhanced atomic operations and cache validation
5. **Zero ETV Double Counting** - Prevented duplicate visibility processing
6. **Unknown ETV Filter Issue** - Fixed items remaining visible after receiving ETV data
7. **Account Page Null Element Error** - Added null checks with retry logic

## Open Issues

### P1 Critical: Race Condition with Rapid Item Updates

**Status**: Under Investigation (Debug instrumentation added)

**Impact**:

- Items arriving within ~28ms cause visibility/count desynchronization
- Incorrect item counts in browser tab
- Unreliable filter states during high-volume updates

**Proposed Solutions**:

- Implement synchronous visibility updates with proper locking
- Use atomic operations for count updates
- Add debouncing for rapid state changes
- Queue-based processing for WebSocket messages

## Performance Improvements Roadmap

### Phase 1: DOM Query Optimization

- **Problem**: Excessive DOM queries (100ms+ with 500 items)
- **Solution**: Implement caching layer and batch DOM queries
- **Target**: <50ms for 1000 items

### Phase 2: Virtual Scrolling Implementation

- **Problem**: All items remain in DOM regardless of viewport
- **Solution**: Intersection observer-based virtual scrolling
- **Target**: Maintain 60fps with 2000+ items
- **Benefits**: Constant memory usage, improved scrolling, better load times

### Phase 3: Algorithm Optimization

- **Problem**: O(nÂ²) sorting complexity
- **Solution**: Efficient sort with DocumentFragment batching
- **Target**: <100ms sort for 1000 items

### Phase 4: Memory Management

- **Problems**:
    - Uncleared intervals in MasterSlave.js and ServerCom.js
    - NotificationMonitor instance leaks
    - KeywordMatch object retention (3MB each)
- **Solution**: Proper cleanup lifecycle and WeakMap optimization
- **Target**: <100MB memory usage for 1000 items

## Technical Debt Items

1. **Event Delegation**: Replace individual listeners with container-level delegation
2. **Debug Logging**: Fix VisibilityStateManager console logging when debug disabled
3. **Keyword Pattern Sync**: Align compiled patterns with actual keywords
4. **Tile Highlighting**: Fix attribute mismatch between Toolbar.js and Tile.js
5. **Page Flicker**: Prevent item rearrangement on regular Vine pages

## Future Enhancements

### Processing Time Monitoring

- Add performance timing to identify slow ASIN processing
- Log items taking >100ms to process
- Help identify performance bottlenecks

### Dependency Injection Migration

- Currently in progress for Logger service
- Browser API adapters planned
- Improved testability and modularity

## Success Metrics

- Filter operations: <100ms for 1000 items
- Scrolling: 60fps with 2000 items
- Memory usage: <100MB for 1000 items
- Zero memory leaks in 24-hour usage
- 90% reduction in performance complaints

## Testing Strategy

- Performance benchmarks: 100, 500, 1000, 2000 items
- Memory profiling with Chrome DevTools
- Automated regression test suite
- Production performance monitoring

## Implementation Priority

1. **Immediate**: Fix P1 race condition
2. **Short-term**: DOM optimization and caching
3. **Medium-term**: Virtual scrolling
4. **Long-term**: Full performance overhaul
