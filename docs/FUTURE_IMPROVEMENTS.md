# Future Improvements and Optimizations

This document tracks planned improvements that are not yet implemented or are in active development.

## Performance Optimizations

### Virtual Scrolling Implementation

**Status:** Future enhancement

**Current Issue:**
- All items are rendered in the DOM, even those outside viewport
- Memory usage scales linearly with item count
- Performance degrades with large numbers of items

**Proposed Solution:**
- Implement virtual scrolling to only render visible items
- Use Intersection Observer API for viewport detection
- Maintain scroll position during dynamic updates

**Benefits:**
- Constant memory usage regardless of item count
- Improved scrolling performance
- Better initial load times

## Completed Improvements

The following improvements have been completed and documented in other files:

### Performance

- ✅ **Keyword Matching Performance** (Commit: 9b126fb) - See [MEMORY_MANAGEMENT.md](./MEMORY_MANAGEMENT.md)
    - 15x improvement (19.4s → 1.3s)
    - WeakMap-based caching with module-level array storage
- ✅ **Stream Processing Memory Usage** (Commit: a4066e0) - See [MEMORY_MANAGEMENT.md](./MEMORY_MANAGEMENT.md)
    - 95% memory reduction (1.6 MB → 69.2 KB)
    - Named functions and cached settings
- ✅ **Visibility Caching and Management** - See [VISIBILITY_AND_COUNT_MANAGEMENT.md](./VISIBILITY_AND_COUNT_MANAGEMENT.md)
    - Centralized visibility state management
    - WeakMap-based caching with automatic invalidation
    - Batch operations reduce reflows from O(n) to O(1)
    - ~39% performance improvement for filter operations
- ✅ **Memory Optimizations** (Current PR) - See [MEMORY_PROFILE_ANALYSIS.md](./MEMORY_PROFILE_ANALYSIS.md)
    - SharedKeywordMatcher with LRU cache (~50% memory reduction)
    - UnifiedTransformHandler consolidating stream operations (~15% reduction)
    - WeakMap usage for DOM element storage (improved GC)
    - String interning for URLs in ItemsMgr

### Architecture

- ✅ **Dependency Injection** - See [DI_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md](./DI_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md)
- ✅ **Event-Driven Architecture** - See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)
- ✅ **Memory Leak Fixes** - See [MEMORY_MANAGEMENT.md](./MEMORY_MANAGEMENT.md)

### Code Quality

- ✅ **DRY Improvements** - See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)
    - ETV validation logic (hasRequiredEtvData helper)
    - Title validation logic (hasTitle helper)
    - Visibility checking patterns

## Active Development

### Dependency Injection Migration

**Status:** In Progress  
**Details:** See [DI_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md](./DI_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md)

Current focus:

- Logger service migration
- Browser API adapters
- Testing infrastructure

## Implementation Priority

1. **Immediate (Next PR):**

    - Complete DI migration for Logger
    - Browser API adapters

2. **Short-term (Next 2-3 PRs):**

    - Browser API adapters
    - Integration tests for grid operations

3. **Long-term:**
    - See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for full architectural roadmap

## Performance Metrics to Track

1. **Visibility Operations:**

    - Time per visibility check
    - Cache hit rate
    - Event emission frequency

2. **Memory Usage:**

    - See [MEMORY_MANAGEMENT.md](./MEMORY_MANAGEMENT.md) for comprehensive metrics

3. **User Experience:**
    - Filter application speed
    - Sort operation performance
    - UI responsiveness

## Notes

- This document focuses on work not yet started or in early stages
- Completed work is documented in respective files
- Priority may shift based on user feedback and performance metrics
