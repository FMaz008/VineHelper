# PC

A popular extension for desktop (PC) on chrome and firefox is called stylebot, but you can use any extension that supports css injection.
Install with the links below depending on your browser:

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha?hl=en-US

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylebot-web/

- Open stylebot options and go to the tab "Styles"
- Click at "Add a new style..."
- in the "Enter URL..." field use: `https://*.amazon.com/vine*` (or your vine url if you are not from United States)
- in the text area below insert the styles that you desire:

```
@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/desktop/small-items.css);
@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/desktop/remove-header.css);
@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/desktop/remove-footer.css);
@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/desktop/remove-associate-header.css);
@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/desktop/more-description-text.css);
@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/desktop/etv-modal-on-top.css);
@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/desktop/categories-with-emojis.css);
@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/desktop/pagination-on-top.css);
@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/desktop/collapsable-categories.css);
@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/desktop/striped-categories.css);
@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/desktop/limited-quantity-icon.css);
@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/desktop/rfy-afa-ai-tabs.css);
@import url(https://file.llamastories.com/cutoff.css);

```

if you want to use the dark theme, also include:

```
@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/desktop/dark-theme.css);
```

Those are the public styles that we created, if you don't want all of them you can remove the line that represents the functionality that you do not want.
For example `@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/desktop/pagination-on-top.css);` makes the pagination to be on the top of the page, just don't include this line if you don't want that.

### variable-defs.css:

- Use if you want to define your own tile size for the product grid
- Place your override definitions above the small-items.css and more-description-text.css files

### small-items.css:

- Show more items per row in the page

### remove-header.css:

- Removes the website header

### remove-footer.css:

- Removes the website footer

### remove-associate-header.css:

- Removes the website "Amazon Associates" header, in case you are an "Amazon Associate"

### more-description-text.css:

- Show a smaller font for each product on the grid and display 3 lines of description instead of 2

### etv-modal-on-top.css

- Show the ETV of the product on top of the modal instead of the bottom

### categories-with-emojis.css

- Show emojis on the left side of each category (if you are from UK, use categories-with-emojis-UK.css instead. Or categories-with-emojis-FR.css for France)

### pagination-on-top.css

- Show the grid pagination on top instead of bottom

### collapsable-categories.css

- Collapses the categories on the left when not being hovered, good for when your screen is not very big

### striped-categories.css

- Change alignment and background color for the categories to improve readability

### limited-quantity-icon.css

- Change the text "Limited Quantity" on the modal to be an icon on the bottom left

### rfy-afa-ai-tabs.css

- Change the product tabs text to RFY | AFA | AI

### dark-theme.css

- Enables dark theme on all vine pages

### item-zoom.css

- Adds a zoom on the image when you pass the mouse over the products. Only works well if you do not use collapsable-categories.css

### cutoff.css

- Highlights the last items that dropped on the previous day
- Change the background color by adding a setting for ``--custom-cutoff-background-color''

## Customization

If you want to customize just the product grid, you can place a block that will override the sizing at the very top. The stylesheet will automatically adjust a few other proportions if you define only `--custom-item-tile-size`.

You must have variable-defs.css included immediately below your definition. Other variables you can use are listed in the file variable-defs.css.

if you want to customize some other specific style you can also open the files that you want to customize, copy the part that you want changed and include at the _bottom_ of the stylebot file. This way you can tweak the numbers that you want customized.

Example:

```
:root{
  --custom-item-tile-height:50px;
}

@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/desktop/variable-defs.css);
@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/desktop/small-items.css);
/* ... all other imports ... */
@import url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/desktop/collapsable-categories.css);

.a-button-primary {
    background: plum !important;
    border-color: plum !important;
}
.a-button-primary:hover .a-button-text {
    color: white !important;
}
.a-button-primary:hover {
    background: purple !important;
    border-color: violet !important;
}

```

This makes the items smaller by setting `--custom-item-tile-size` at the top.

The css at the bottom changes the See Details button color to use plum, purple, and violet.

# Android

For Android, we recommend a browser called "Kiwi Browser", this browser supports extensions.

(Google chrome does not support extensions on android and firefox only have a limited quantity of extensions)

download: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiwibrowser.browser&hl=en_US&gl=US

Inside kiwi browser you can install "Stylebot" as well:

- Click "..." > extensions
- Click at "+ (from store)"
- Search for stylebot
- Click "Add to chrome" (it says that, but it will add to Kiwi)

After installing stylebot:

- Download the file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/mobile/import-android.json here from the github (you can hold your finger on the link and click "Download Link")
- Open stylebot options and go to the tab "Sync" (Tab Styles does not work very well on mobile, not sure why)
- Click on "Import" and select the downloaded file
- If you are not from united states, change the url `https://www.amazon.com/vine` to the respective vine url in your country

On android there is also a neat app called Choose Browser https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.ub0r.android.choosebrowser&hl=en_US&gl=US that let you pick a different browser for different urls.
For example, if you are on discord you can make all amazon clicks open on kiwi and other links open on chrome.

# iPhone

Both the Safari extension and alternate browser techniques use products from the company Laso Technologies Inc.

## Alternative browser method

For iPhone, we recommend a browser called "Insight Browser", this browser supports extensions.

download: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/insight-browser/id1531407280

(Safari does support extensions, but it also have a limited quantity)

Inside Insight Browser, go to settings and click on:

- See all Extensions
- Add a extension
- Give it any name
- Change the "IF" condition to: "url matches regex"
- give it the value: `^https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/vine` (or your vine url if you are not from United States))
- change the "then" condition to "inject Css from URL"
- use the url: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/mobile/ios-with-bugfix.css`

## Safari extension method

There is a downloadable extension for Safari called "Hyperweb" that supports alternate stylesheets.

download: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hyperweb/id1581824571

docs: https://guide.hyperweb.app

custom css docs: https://guide.hyperweb.app/styling/custom-css/

Hyperweb also works on desktop Mac and PC for Chrome and Firefox. You may determine you prefer the performance of a different browser and extension.

for iOS and iPadOS:

- open the Hyperweb app
- follow the instructions to change your settings
- tap "Advanced" in the bottom bar
- tap "Create Local Extension"
- name your customization
- tap + next to New Condition
- tap Condition Type? and select "URL matches RegEx"
- under the "Then" section tap "Add Action"
- select "Inject CSS from URL"
- give it the value: `^https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/vine` (or your vine url if you are not from United States)
- change the "then" condition to "inject Css from URL"
- use the url: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorvarium/vine-styling/main/mobile/ios-with-bugfix.css`

## Additional customizations

Both are limited to custom css hosted from a url, and not css definitions saved in the stylesheets.

However, you can write and host your own overrides to the styles defined in the vine-styling project. You create a .css file. You make the css changes you wish to see.
Then add an additional Action for your configuration, specifying the URL to your CSS file.

To adjust tile sizes, if you are using mobile.css, the variable-defs.css file is not necessary. You will still need to create and host a css file that contains the redefined values.

Your hosting choices are up to you, but options include

- dropbox
- Using a file saved in your iCloud drive https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/352163/obtain-a-private-url-to-a-file-in-icloud-drive-without-making-the-file-available
- Forking this project, adding a file, and linking to the "raw" URL.
